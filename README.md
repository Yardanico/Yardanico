## Yardanico's small corner

Hello there! My name is Danil Yarantsev, I'm your average 20-year old Russian student.

I speak these languages:
  - 🇷🇺 Russian (native)
  - 🇬🇧 English (~B2-C1)
  - 👑 Nim

My accounts elsewhere:
  - [Telegram](https://t.me/yardanico) - I spend a lot of time chatting in Telegram 
  - [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/Yardanico) - mostly for entertainment and time-killing
  - [Twitch](twitch.tv/yardanico) - I occasionally stream osu! (a rhythm game), Nim programming, or some other random things like listening to music
  - [Habrahabr](https://habr.com/users/yardanico/) - I have two articles about Nim published here (both in Russian)
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yardanic0) - I'm not an active Twitter user, so I just like and retweet good tweets once in a while
  - [VKontakte](https://vk.com/id170831732) - rarely use VK, but will reply to the messages

Favourite music - it's complicated. Check out [my main music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnthTbhS8ZO9m8nkK25JYC4CIphFvHk7r) to understand why.

You can also drop me an email on tiberiumk12 &lt;at&gt; gmail.com if you want :)
