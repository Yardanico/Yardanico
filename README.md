## Yardanico's small corner

Hello there! My name is Danil Yarantsev. I'm your average 20-year old Russian student.

I speak these languages:
  - ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russian (native)
  - ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English (~B2-C1)
  - ðŸ‘‘ Nim

Favourite music genre(s) - it isn't easy to tell precisely. Check out [my main music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnthTbhS8ZO9m8nkK25JYC4CIphFvHk7r) to understand why.

Some of my projects:
 - [ircord](https://github.com/Yardanico/ircord) - Discord <-> IRC bridge written in Nim, written for the Nim Discord server but should work for any discord/irc server combination with some little tweaks (feel free contact me if you want to get it running for your server!).
 - [nim-snippets](https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-snippets) - a collection of my smaller Nim snippets/projects that(in my opinion) don't need a separate repository. There you can find things like Telegram bots, nimble package dependency graphing, Nim IRC logs parsing and more. 
 - [nimeventer](https://github.com/Yardanico/nimeventer) - small Nim program to post new Nim forum/subreddit/StackOverflow updates onto Discord, IRC, Telegram to let the community know about new posts/threads.
 - [pylib](https://github.com/Yardanico/nimpylib) - a pretty silly library which brings some of Python built-in functions or operators to Nim :)
 - [mathexpr](https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-mathexpr) - a small and straightforward Nim library to evaluate your math expressions (recursive-descent in-tree evaluating), supports adding custom Nim functions or variables.

Of course, there's more, but it wouldn't make sense to put every repo of mine in there.
