## Yardanico's small corner

Hello there! My name is Danil Yarantsev, I'm your average 20-year old Russian student.

I speak these languages:
  - 🇷🇺 Russian (native)
  - 🇬🇧 English (~B2-C1)
  - 👑 Nim

My accounts elsewhere:
  - [Telegram](https://t.me/yardanico) - I spend a lot of time chatting in Telegram :P
  - [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/Yardanico) - mostly for entertainment and time-killing 🤷‍♂️
  - [Twitch](twitch.tv/yardanico) - I occasionally stream osu! (a rhythm game), Nim programming, or some other random things like listening to music.
  - [Habrahabr](https://habr.com/users/yardanico/) - I have two articles about Nim published here (both in Russian).
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yardanic0) - I'm not an active Twitter user, so I just like and retweet good tweets once in a while.
  - [VKontakte](https://vk.com/id170831732) - rarely use VK, but will reply to the messages.

Favourite music genre(s) - it's complicated. Check out [my main music playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnthTbhS8ZO9m8nkK25JYC4CIphFvHk7r) to understand why.

Some of my projects:
 - [ircord](https://github.com/Yardanico/ircord) - Discord <-> IRC bridge written in Nim, written for the Nim Discord server but should work for any discord/irc server combination with some little tweaks (feel free contact me if you want to get it running for your server!)
 - [nim-snippets](https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-snippets) - a collection of my smaller Nim stuff which (in my opinion) doesn't deserve to have its own repo. There you can find stuff like Telegram bots, nimble package dependency graphing, Nim IRC logs parsing and more. 
 - [nimeventer](https://github.com/Yardanico/nimeventer) - small Nim program to post new Nim forum/subreddit updates onto Discord, IRC, Telegram to let the community know about new posts/threads.
 - [pylib](https://github.com/Yardanico/nimpylib) - a pretty silly library which brings some of Python built-in functions or operators to Nim :)
 - [mathexpr](https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-mathexpr) - a small and simple Nim library to evaluate your math expressions (recursive-descent in-tree evaluating), supports adding custom Nim functions or variables.
Of course there's more, but it wouldn't make sense to put every repo of mine in there.

You can also drop me an email on tiberiumk12 &lt;at&gt; gmail.com if you want :)
